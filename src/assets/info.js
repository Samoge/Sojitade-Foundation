    newsContent: `Every woman and girl experiences menstruation, which is a normal biological process. Menstruation, however, may be a cause of shame and embarrassment for many young girls and women over the world. This is a result of the stigma associated with menstruation, which is frequently perceived as a filthy or taboo subject.
    The Pad Tour is a program that attempts to eliminate the stigma associated with menstruation and to give underprivileged girls and young women access to menstrual hygiene products and education. Sojitade Foundation, Kids & Teens Resource Centre, YALI Ondo Chapter, Mercy Speaks Initiatives, The Speaking Voice, and the Ondo State chapter of the Medical Women Association of Nigeria organized the event.
